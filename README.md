# LeetCode Daily Challenges

As a way to sharpen my C# skills and overall problem-solving ability, I challenge myself with one LeetCode problem each day. This repository serves both as a personal log of my progress and as a source of reference or inspiration for future solutions.

To be committed, a solution must perform better than at least 50% of submissions in either runtime or memory usage.

My goal is to improve consistency, learn efficient coding patterns, and build strong intuition for algorithmic thinking.
